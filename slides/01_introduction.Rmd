## The problem

LaTeX

report

## The solution

Pagedown (ie Pagedjs + R)

How it works -> create a special web page and print it
=> web tools

+ strength of parametrised reporting

**==> put all the following after the HTML/CSS intro**

## Examples of HTML

You can show the HTML content of your document by opening it in Chrome and use the DevTools (Inspect). It shows you the differents divs.

EXAMPLE GIF : 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img/chrome_devtools.gif"))
```

## Examples of HTML

You can also use special div with `:::name-of-the-div` and closing it with `:::`.

EXAMPLE WITH col div

## In `pagedown`

You have special divs created by Pagedjs for each page + margins.
It's better to handle them in the CSS.

## Example of CSS

On the other side :

- make example of CSS text change with color/font-size
